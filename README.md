Hi, I'm kee. Always doing *something*, but mostly just random stuff that never makes it here publicly, if at all. But, if you'd like to know what I'm working on, I've listed what I wish to formally announce below.

Project | Description | Preview
--- | --- | ---
Keeterial | Already known to be used across Kee7702 websites, however in the background I've been working on a new, improved framework, featuring themes, and a reconsideration for the flow of the layout. Soon to be all in Jekyll, with ready-to-use presets. This will lead into a major overhaul of my website. | ![Screen Shot 2025-06-02 at 17 34 44](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/399a71c2-2fe1-471a-9c48-b1e6986fa4e9)
VersionDB | Originally released in 2023, the next major update is going to be the largest functionality shift in a while, including pagination, download metadata, and RSS support along with various other features. This update will also bring with it a release of the backend code making it work. | ![Screen Shot 2025-06-02 at 17 34 54](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e98d5c9-7008-4c4b-bd82-b1a3099b27a1)
